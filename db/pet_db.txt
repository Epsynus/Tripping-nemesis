//In theory you can use any valid script, but it is run only once upon pet
//loading, so it is recommended you use the specific pet scripts:

//petskillattack skillid, skilllv, rate, bonusrate
//Skill attack that triggers while the pet is attacking. Rate is the base
//chance of execution per attack. Bonusrate is an additional success rate when
//intimacy reaches max.

//petskillattack2 skillid, damage, hits, rate, bonusrate
//Same as petskillattack, but the damage and number of hits is fixed
//the damage specified is total, not per hit.

//petskillsupport skillid, skilllv, delay, hp%, sp%
//Casts a support skill when the health levels are below the specified hp% and
//sp%. Delay is the minimum time in seconds before the skill can be cast again

//petheal amount, delay, hp%, sp%
//Similar to petskillsupport, but the skill is fixed to heal (28) and the
//heal-amount is fixed to the value given.

//petrecovery type, delay: Cures the "type" status effect after "delay" seconds

//petskillbonus type, value, duration, delay
//Gives bonus stats. Type is the stat to increase (bStr, bLuk), value is the
//amount by which it is increased, duration signals how long the bonus lasts
//delay is the time elapsed after the bonus ends and before it starts again.

//A single pet can have petloot, petskillbonus, petskillattack (or
//petskillattack2) and petskillsupport (or petheal) at the same time,
//but only one of each.
