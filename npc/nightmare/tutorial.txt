	mes "What is Oplex?";
	mes "Oplex is a survival horror MMO made from the eAthena engine (for Ragnarok Online, hence the art style and similar interface - yet different gameplay and mechanics, of course) that aims to emphasize the 'survival' portion of horror games. Nowadays, too many games focus on action gameplay and not so much on trying to let the character survive. In addition, MMORPGs tend to be very mechanical; players are thrown into a world where they perform meaningless and menial tasks, such as hunting down x amounts of items for no reason. Oplex wants to change all of that; survivors, such as yourself, are thrown into a cruel world where resources are scarce, zombies rule the world, and other survivors are not to be trusted. Of course, cooperation will allow bands of survivors to thrive, but how long will that last when resources dwindle?";
	next;
	mes @npcname$;
	mes "The gameplay mechanics of Oplex works differently than many MMOs. First of all, let's highlight stats:";
	mes "Where as stats and leveling up are important in other games (RPGs), they are not in Oplex. Or well, not in the traditional sense. The first thing you need to know is that there is no TRUE leveling in Oplex. You will remain at level one in the game the entire game.";
	next;
	mes @npcname$;
	mes "That has always been Oplex's first distinct feature. Secondly, many stats do not affect your combat skills - rather, they are there to assist you in dealing with the environment (which will be added in the near future); for example, survivors with high strength may move boulders while survivors with low strength may not; another example could be that survivors with high intelligence will spend less time hacking computers or rewiring things than survivors with lower intelligence.";
	next;
	mes @npcname$;
	mes "This leads to the emphasis on equipment. In a post-apocalyptic world, what matters most is what you have. If you have a gun over the other survivor with a pocket knife, you are far more likely to deal more damage to him than he is to you; of course, factoring in the importance of talent is crucial, but there will be more information regarding that in the near future.";
	next;
	mes @npcname$;

Others will kill you for your items (raiders). And still others will kill you just because they want to (psychopaths).";
	next;
